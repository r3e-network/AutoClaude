# AutoClaude v3.15.1 - Critical Command Registration Fix

## üö® Critical Fix Release

This release fixes a critical issue that prevented the VS Code extension from working properly.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed critical command registration error**: Resolved "command 'autoclaude.start' not found" error that prevented the extension from loading
- **Fixed ES module/CommonJS conflict**: Updated src/index.ts to properly export both ES6 and CommonJS formats for VS Code compatibility
- **Updated all command descriptions**: Changed from "Claude: xxx" to "AutoClaude: xxx" for consistent branding (35 commands)
- **Updated agent farm commands**: Changed from "Claude Agent Farm" to "AutoClaude Agent Farm" category (8 commands)

## üí´ Improvements

- **Enhanced command registration**: Improved module export compatibility to ensure all 43 commands work correctly
- **Better branding consistency**: All commands now use "AutoClaude" prefix for clearer identification
- **Added command verification**: Created test script to validate all commands are properly registered

## üîÑ Technical Details

The main issue was in `src/index.ts` where the module exports were not compatible with VS Code's CommonJS requirements:

**Before (broken):**
```typescript
import { activate as activateExtension, deactivate as deactivateExtension } from './extension';
export const activate = activateExtension;
export const deactivate = deactivateExtension;
```

**After (fixed):**
```typescript
import { activate as activateExtension, deactivate as deactivateExtension } from './extension';
export const activate = activateExtension;
export const deactivate = deactivateExtension;

// Also export as CommonJS for compatibility
if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) {
  module.exports = {
    activate: activateExtension,
    deactivate: deactivateExtension
  };
}
```
