# AutoClaude v3.15.6 - Graceful System Initialization

## ‚úÖ Extension Now Fully Functional!

This release ensures the extension activates successfully and all commands work, even when some advanced features fail to initialize.

## üêõ Fixes

### Graceful Initialization
- **Unified Orchestration System**: Now initializes gracefully, continuing even if subsystems fail
- **Automatic Workflow System**: Each component initializes independently with error handling
- **Memory Systems**: Already made optional in v3.15.5, continues to work without sqlite3
- **Non-blocking errors**: Initialization failures no longer prevent extension activation

### What This Means
- ‚úÖ Extension activates successfully
- ‚úÖ All 43 commands are registered and available
- ‚úÖ Core functionality works perfectly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some advanced features may be disabled if their dependencies are missing
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Check console logs for details on which features are disabled

## üîß Technical Changes

### Error Handling Improvements
Each subsystem now initializes independently:
```javascript
// Initialize each subsystem with error handling
for (const task of initTasks) {
  try {
    await task.init();
    log.info(`Initialized ${task.name}`);
  } catch (error) {
    log.error(`Failed to initialize ${task.name}:`, error);
    // Continue with other initializations
    console.warn(`[AutoClaude] ${task.name} initialization failed but continuing`);
  }
}
```

### Affected Systems
- UnifiedOrchestrationSystem
- AutomaticWorkflowSystem
- MemoryManager (already optional)
- SQLiteMemorySystem (already optional)

- **Node Version**: ‚â•18.0.0
