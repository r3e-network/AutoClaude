OK, please continue executing on the plan and tracking progress. Make sure to:

1. Reference back to the best practices guide to ensure you are conforming to the guidelines
2. Update the implementation progress document to ensure it is ACTUALLY accurate in all respects and doesn't exaggerate or mislead about what has been successfully completed
3. Focus on approximately {chunk_size} improvements in this iteration

If you notice that previous claims of completion were premature (e.g., only a few example files were updated when many more need the same changes), please:
- Correct the progress tracking to reflect reality
- Continue applying the changes to ALL relevant files
- Be thorough and systematic in your approach

Remember:
- Use cp and mv commands when restructuring files, not manual recreation
- Make frequent references back to the best practices guide
- Update the progress document with accurate status
- Consider the full scope of the codebase, not just examples

When you're done with this batch, commit your progress to git with a detailed commit message.
