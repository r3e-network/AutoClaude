First I need you to CAREFULLY review the guide in best_practices_guides/SERVERLESS_EDGE_BEST_PRACTICES.md. Then I want you to begin the process of systematically revising the serverless and edge computing code in this project to conform to this guide.

Create a new document called SERVERLESS_EDGE_BEST_PRACTICES_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md where you keep track of what you've done and what remains to be done. This document should:
- List each major section and guideline from the best practices guide
- Track the implementation status of each guideline (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Include specific notes about what was changed and what files were affected
- Note which platform (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, Lambda, etc.) each component targets
- Be ACTUALLY accurate and not exaggerate or mislead about completion status

You don't need to try to do everything in the guide all at once. Work on approximately {chunk_size} changes or improvements at a time, focusing on one or two related guidelines such as:
- Choosing the right architecture (edge vs traditional serverless)
- Cold start optimization strategies
- WASM integration patterns
- State management at the edge (Durable Objects, KV stores)
- Performance optimization and resource limits

IMPORTANT:
- Consider platform-specific constraints (CPU time, memory limits)
- Use appropriate runtime APIs for each platform
- Implement proper error handling for distributed systems
- Add comprehensive TypeScript types for edge runtime APIs
- Test locally using platform-specific tools (wrangler, vercel dev, etc.)
- Consider multi-region deployment strategies
- Document platform requirements and limitations

When you're done with this batch of improvements, commit your progress to git with a detailed commit message explaining what best practices were implemented.
