First I need you to CAREFULLY review any best practices guides in the best_practices_guides/ directory. Then I want you to begin the process of systematically improving the code in this project to conform to modern best practices for this technology stack.

Create a new document called BEST_PRACTICES_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md where you keep track of what you've done and what remains to be done. This document should:
- List each major best practice or guideline being applied
- Track the implementation status of each practice (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Include specific notes about what was changed and what files were affected
- Be ACTUALLY accurate and not exaggerate or mislead about completion status

Work on approximately {chunk_size} improvements at a time, focusing on related best practices. Keep close track of what has been done already and what remains to be done at a granular level.

Focus on improvements such as:
- Code organization and project structure
- Performance optimizations
- Security best practices
- Modern language/framework features
- Testing and error handling
- Documentation and code clarity
- Removing deprecated patterns

IMPORTANT:
- Make changes incrementally to avoid breaking functionality
- Update the progress document after each set of changes
- Be honest about partial implementations
- Test your changes when possible

When you're done with this batch of improvements, commit your progress to git with a detailed commit message explaining what best practices were implemented.
