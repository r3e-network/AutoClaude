First I need you to CAREFULLY review the guide in best_practices_guides/BASH_AND_ZSH_SCRIPTING_FOR_UBUNTU.md. Then I want you to begin the process of systematically revising the shell scripts in this project to conform to this guide.

Create a new document called BASH_ZSH_BEST_PRACTICES_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md where you keep track of what you've done and what remains to be done. This document should:
- List each major section and guideline from the best practices guide
- Track the implementation status of each guideline (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Include specific notes about what was changed and what scripts were affected
- Note which scripts are Bash vs Zsh and handle them appropriately
- Be ACTUALLY accurate and not exaggerate or mislead about completion status

You don't need to try to do everything in the guide all at once. Work on approximately {chunk_size} changes or improvements at a time, focusing on one or two related guidelines such as:
- Error handling patterns (set -euo pipefail, trap handlers)
- Modern script architecture and modularization
- Input validation and argument parsing
- Security practices and safe command execution
- Performance optimizations and parallel processing

IMPORTANT:
- Test scripts after modifications to ensure they still work correctly
- Use ShellCheck to validate changes and fix any issues
- Maintain backward compatibility where appropriate
- Update shebang lines to use the recommended patterns
- Consider the impact on both interactive and non-interactive scripts
- Add proper documentation and usage functions

When you're done with this batch of improvements, commit your progress to git with a detailed commit message explaining what best practices were implemented.
