First I need you to CAREFULLY review any Python best practices guides in the best_practices_guides/ directory. If no specific guide exists, apply general Python best practices including:
- PEP 8 style guidelines
- Type hints on all functions and methods
- Proper error handling with specific exception types
- Clear docstrings following Google or NumPy style
- Async/await patterns where appropriate
- Proper dependency injection and avoiding global state
- Efficient data structures and algorithms

Create a new document called PYTHON_BEST_PRACTICES_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md where you keep track of what you've done and what remains to be done. This document should:
- List each major best practice category being applied
- Track the implementation status of each practice (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Include specific notes about what was changed and what files were affected
- Be ACTUALLY accurate and not exaggerate or mislead about completion status

Work on approximately {chunk_size} improvements at a time, focusing on related best practices. Keep close track of what has been done already and what remains to be done at a granular level.

IMPORTANT:
- Use proper refactoring techniques to avoid breaking existing functionality
- Add type hints incrementally, ensuring they're accurate
- Update the progress document after each set of changes
- Consider the impact on tests and update them as needed
- Be honest about partial implementations

When you're done with this batch of improvements, commit your progress to git with a detailed commit message explaining what best practices were implemented.
