First I need you to CAREFULLY review the guide in best_practices_guides/GENAI_LLM_OPS_BEST_PRACTICES.md. Then I want you to begin the process of systematically revising the code in this project to conform to this guide.

Create a new document called GENAI_LLM_OPS_BEST_PRACTICES_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md where you keep track of what you've done and what remains to be done. This document should:
- List each major section and guideline from the best practices guide
- Track the implementation status of each guideline (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Include specific notes about what was changed and what files were affected
- Be ACTUALLY accurate and not exaggerate or mislead about completion status

You don't need to try to do everything in the guide all at once. Work on approximately {chunk_size} changes or improvements at a time, focusing on one or two related guidelines. Keep close track of what has been done already and what remains to be done at a granular level so we can eventually have confidence that the entire guide has been fully and completely implemented.

IMPORTANT: 
- Implement the four-layer LLM stack architecture (Application, Orchestration, Data/Context, Model Serving)
- Use LangGraph for complex agent workflows and state management
- Implement proper RAG patterns with multi-stage retrieval and reranking
- Set up streaming for real-time user experience
- Configure proper observability with OpenTelemetry
- Update the progress document after each set of changes
- Be honest about partial implementations - if you only updated a few components, say so
- Consider production requirements like GPU optimization and cost management

When you're done with this batch of improvements, commit your progress to git with a detailed commit message explaining what best practices were implemented.
