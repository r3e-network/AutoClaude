### üìä Advanced Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time web-based monitoring interface
- Visual indicators for agent status and health
- Context usage tracking with automatic clearing
- Heartbeat monitoring detects stuck agents
- Generate HTML reports with comprehensive statistics

### ü§ù Cooperating Agents Protocol
- Advanced coordination system for multi-agent collaboration
- File and feature locking prevents conflicts
- Work registry tracks active and completed tasks
- Planned work queue with priority management
- Stale lock detection and automatic recovery

### üõ†Ô∏è Multi-Tech Stack Support
- 34 pre-configured technology stacks
- Automatic project type detection
- Stack-specific prompts and best practices
- Custom stack configuration support
- Dynamic chunk sizing based on project type

### üíæ Enhanced Error Recovery
- Automatic settings backup and restore
- Corruption detection with auto-recovery
- Lock-based concurrent access prevention
- Atomic file operations for safety
- Comprehensive error handling

### üìã Work Distribution System
- Intelligent chunk-based task assignment
- Priority-based work queue management
- Dynamic chunk sizing based on remaining work
- Conflict detection and prevention
- Progress tracking with completion markers

## New Commands

1. **Start Parallel Agents** (`autoclaude.startParallelAgents`)
   - Launch multiple Claude agents
   - Choose number of agents (1-50)
   - Automatic tmux session management

2. **Show Agent Monitor** (`autoclaude.showAgentMonitor`)
   - Open real-time monitoring dashboard
   - View agent status and progress
   - Track context usage and errors

3. **Attach to Agent Session** (`autoclaude.attachToAgents`)
   - View agents working in terminal
   - Direct tmux access for debugging
   - See real-time agent activity

4. **Clear All Agent Context** (`autoclaude.clearAllAgentContext`)
   - Broadcast `/clear` to all agents
   - Free up context across all agents
   - Single keystroke operation

5. **Stop Parallel Agents** (`autoclaude.stopParallelAgents`)
   - Gracefully stop all agents
   - Clean up resources
   - Save final state

## Configuration Options

New settings in VS Code:

```json
{
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.enabled": true,
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.maxAgents": 50,
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.defaultAgents": 5,
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.staggerDelay": 10,
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.contextThreshold": 20,
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.autoRestart": true,
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.checkInterval": 10,
  "autoclaude.parallelAgents.coordinationEnabled": false
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### New Components
- `ParallelAgentOrchestrator` - Core orchestration engine
- `AgentMonitor` - Real-time monitoring system
- `WorkDistributor` - Task distribution manager
- `CoordinationProtocol` - Multi-agent coordination
- `TechStackManager` - Technology stack configuration
- `SettingsManager` - Enhanced settings management

### Architecture Improvements
- Modular component design
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full TypeScript type safety
- Extensive unit test coverage
- Production-ready code quality

## Use Cases

### Large-Scale Code Improvements
- Fix all linting errors across entire codebase
- Add comprehensive type annotations
- Implement consistent error handling
- Refactor legacy code patterns

### Systematic Best Practices
- Apply coding standards uniformly
- Add missing documentation
- Implement security best practices
- Optimize performance bottlenecks

### Parallel Development Tasks
- Multiple feature implementations
- Distributed bug fixing
- Concurrent test writing
- Parallel documentation updates

## Requirements

- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer for agent sessions
- **VS Code 1.74.0+** - Extension platform
- **Claude Code** - AI assistant (already required)
- **Python 3.8+** - Process management (already required)

## Migration Notes

This update is fully backward compatible. Existing AutoClaude features continue to work as before. The parallel agent system is opt-in and can be enabled through the command palette.

## Future Enhancements

- Visual agent workflow designer
- Custom agent templates
- Advanced work scheduling
- Cross-project agent coordination
- Cloud-based agent farms
