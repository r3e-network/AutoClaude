# AutoClaude v3.15.5 - Critical Fix: SQLite3 Dependency

## üö® CRITICAL FIX

This release fixes the "Cannot find module 'sqlite3'" error that was preventing the extension from activating.

## üêõ Root Cause Found and Fixed

### The Problem
- Extension was failing to activate with: `Cannot find module 'sqlite3'`
- sqlite3 was marked as external in build config but not bundled with extension
- This prevented ALL commands from being registered

### The Solution
- Made sqlite3 and sqlite modules **optional**
- Extension now works without these dependencies
- Memory features gracefully degrade when sqlite3 is not available
- All core functionality remains intact

## üîß Technical Changes

### Made SQLite Optional
All memory-related modules now check for sqlite3 availability:
```javascript
let sqlite3: any;
try {
  sqlite3 = require("sqlite3").verbose();
} catch (error) {
  console.warn("[AutoClaude] sqlite3 not available - memory features will be disabled");
  sqlite3 = null;
}
```

### Files Updated
- `src/memory/MemoryManager.ts`
- `src/memory/SQLiteMemorySystem.ts`
- `src/memory/MemoryManager.production.ts`

## ‚úÖ What This Means

1. **Extension will now activate successfully**
2. **All 43 commands will be registered and available**
3. **Memory features will be disabled but can be enabled by installing sqlite3 separately if needed**
4. **Core AutoClaude functionality works perfectly**
