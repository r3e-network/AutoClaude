# Release Notes - v3.12.0

## 🎉 New Features

### MockDataDetectionAgent
- **Comprehensive Mock Data Detection**: New specialized SubAgent that automatically detects and reports mock, sample, and placeholder data in production code
- **14 Detection Patterns**: Identifies various types of non-production data including:
  - Sample data comments and arrays
  - Mock implementations and services
  - Test IDs and placeholder names
  - Test emails and URLs
  - Lorem ipsum text
  - Temporary code comments
  - Debug console statements
  - Hardcoded localhost URLs
- **Intelligent Exclusions**: Automatically excludes test files, mock directories, and the detection agent itself
- **Severity Levels**: Categorizes issues as errors (critical) or warnings
- **Actionable Suggestions**: Provides specific recommendations for replacing mock data
- **CI/CD Integration**: Returns proper exit codes for pipeline integration

### SubAgent System Enhancement
- Integrated MockDataDetectionAgent into the SubAgent registry
- Added YAML configuration support for flexible pattern management
- Enhanced production readiness validation capabilities

## 🔧 Improvements

### Detection Accuracy
- Refined exclusion patterns to prevent false positives
- Added self-exclusion for mock detection components
- Improved pattern matching for various programming styles

### Documentation
