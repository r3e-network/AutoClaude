- Context-aware execution

### 2. **Cross-Session Task Persistence**
- Tasks persist across VSCode sessions
- Automatic progress tracking
- Work resumption after interruptions
- Complete task history

### 3. **Specialized Sub-Agents**
- 12+ specialized agents for different tasks
- Each agent has specific capabilities
- Agents work together to complete complex tasks
- Extensible architecture for custom agents

### 4. **Automatic Error Recovery**
- Real-time task health monitoring
- Pattern-based error detection
- Multiple recovery strategies
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

## Architecture Components

### Core Components

#### 1. **CommandOrchestrator** (`src/automation/commandOrchestrator.ts`)
The brain of the automation system that:
- Interprets high-level commands
- Matches commands to workflow templates
- Coordinates task execution
- Manages workflow state and progress

#### 2. **TaskDecomposer** (`src/automation/taskDecomposer.ts`)
Breaks down complex commands into manageable subtasks:
- Provides workflow templates for common tasks
- Handles task dependencies
- Estimates time for each step
- Prioritizes task execution

#### 3. **ProjectIndexer** (`src/context/projectIndexer.ts`)
Provides comprehensive project understanding:
- Indexes all project files
- Extracts symbols and patterns
- Analyzes code complexity
- Tracks file relationships

#### 4. **TaskPersistenceManager** (`src/context/taskPersistence.ts`)
Ensures work continuity:
- Persists tasks to disk
- Maintains task history
- Enables cross-session continuity
- Tracks task context and progress

#### 5. **TaskResumptionEngine** (`src/automation/taskResumptionEngine.ts`)
Monitors and recovers tasks:
- Real-time health monitoring
- Detects interrupted work
- Generates recovery plans
- Automatically resumes failed tasks

### Specialized Sub-Agents

#### Production Agents
1. **TestFixerAgent**: Analyzes and fixes failing unit tests
2. **TestCreatorAgent**: Creates unit tests for untested code
3. **DocGeneratorAgent**: Creates comprehensive documentation
4. **DockerCreatorAgent**: Generates Docker configuration
5. **CodeCleanerAgent**: Cleans and organizes codebase

#### Creation Agents
1. **ProjectInitializerAgent**: Creates new projects from specifications
2. **WebsiteBuilderAgent**: Creates beautiful, responsive websites
3. **RequirementAnalyzerAgent**: Analyzes requirements and creates specs

#### Git Agents
1. **CommitCreatorAgent**: Creates meaningful commit messages
2. **PRCreatorAgent**: Automates pull request creation

## Usage

### Via Command Palette
1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Run `AutoClaude: Execute Automation Command`
3. Enter your high-level command
4. Watch the system work

### Example Commands

```
"make project production ready"
"fix all failing tests"
"add comprehensive documentation"
"create a React website with authentication"
"add Docker support"
"clean up the codebase"
"create unit tests for all components"
```

### Command Execution Flow

1. **Command Input**: User enters a high-level command
2. **Analysis**: CommandOrchestrator analyzes the command
3. **Decomposition**: TaskDecomposer creates a workflow
4. **Persistence**: Tasks are saved for reliability
5. **Execution**: Sub-agents execute individual tasks
6. **Monitoring**: TaskResumptionEngine monitors progress
7. **Recovery**: Automatic recovery if tasks fail
8. **Completion**: Summary provided to user

## Workflow Templates

### Production Ready Workflow
```javascript
{
  id: 'production-ready',
  name: 'Make Project Production Ready',
  estimatedTime: 30,
  steps: [
    'Analyze project structure',
    'Fix all unit tests',
    'Add missing tests (80% coverage)',
    'Generate documentation',
    'Create Docker configuration',
    'Clean up code',
    'Run final validation'
  ]
}
```

### Test Coverage Workflow
```javascript
{
  id: 'test-coverage',
  name: 'Improve Test Coverage',
  estimatedTime: 20,
  steps: [
    'Analyze current coverage',
    'Identify untested code',
    'Generate unit tests',
    'Add integration tests',
    'Validate coverage targets'
  ]
}
```

## Task Persistence

Tasks are stored in `.autopilot/tasks/` with the following structure:

```
.autopilot/
├── tasks/
│   ├── tasks.json        # All task data
│   └── sessions.json     # Session history
├── docs/                 # Generated documentation
├── scripts/              # Quality check scripts
└── context/              # Project context data
```

## Error Recovery Strategies

The system implements multiple recovery strategies:

1. **Retry Strategy**: Retry failed operations with backoff
2. **Skip Strategy**: Skip problematic steps and continue
3. **Alternative Strategy**: Try different approaches
4. **Restart Strategy**: Clean state and restart
5. **Manual Strategy**: Request user intervention

## Extending the System

### Adding New Sub-Agents

1. Create a new agent class extending `BaseProductionAgent`:

```typescript
export class MyCustomAgent extends BaseProductionAgent {
    name = 'My Custom Agent';
    description = 'Does something special';
    capabilities = ['capability1', 'capability2'];
    
    async executeSimple(spec?: string): Promise<{ success: boolean; message: string }> {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

2. Register the agent in the appropriate registry
3. Add to workflow templates if needed

### Adding New Workflows

1. Add to `TaskDecomposer` workflow templates:

```typescript
this.templates.set('my-workflow', {
    id: 'my-workflow',
    name: 'My Custom Workflow',
    estimatedTime: 15,
    steps: [
        { name: 'Step 1', subAgent: 'agent1' },
        { name: 'Step 2', subAgent: 'agent2' }
    ]
});
```

2. Add command patterns to `CommandOrchestrator`

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Commands**: Be specific about what you want
2. **Check Task Status**: Use "Show Tasks" command to see progress
3. **Review Generated Content**: Always review automated changes
4. **Leverage Context**: The system learns from your project
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for notifications and progress updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Automation system not initialized"**
   - Wait a moment after opening VSCode
   - Ensure you have a workspace open

2. **"Task failed to execute"**
   - Check the error message in the summary
   - Review the recovery plan
   - Try a more specific command

3. **"No workflow found"**
   - Use commands that match known patterns
   - Be more specific about the task

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in settings:
```json
{
  "autoclaude.debug": true
}
```

## Future Enhancements
