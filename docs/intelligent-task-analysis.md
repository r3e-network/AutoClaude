# Intelligent Task Analysis and Decomposition System

## Overview

The Intelligent Task Analysis and Decomposition System is a core component of AutoClaude that automatically analyzes natural language commands, breaks them down into logical subtasks, assigns appropriate agents, selects required tools, and orchestrates execution with full production readiness validation.

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Understanding
- Analyzes user commands to understand intent, scope, and requirements
- Extracts entities (files, classes, functions) from the command
- Determines urgency and complexity levels
- Identifies primary action (create, fix, improve, analyze, test, document, deploy, configure)

### 2. Intelligent Task Decomposition
- Automatically breaks complex tasks into logical subtasks
- Creates proper dependency chains between subtasks
- Identifies opportunities for parallel execution
- Estimates duration for each subtask and overall task

### 3. Smart Agent Assignment
- Matches subtask requirements to agent capabilities
- Assigns primary and backup agents for each subtask
- Considers agent specializations:
  - `architect-agent`: System design, API design, database design
  - `coder-agent`: Implementation, refactoring, bug fixing
  - `tester-agent`: Unit testing, integration testing, coverage analysis
  - `researcher-agent`: Code analysis, best practices, pattern discovery
  - `security-agent`: Vulnerability scanning, security audit, compliance
  - `documentation-agent`: API docs, user guides, technical specs
  - `optimization-agent`: Performance tuning, memory optimization
  - `production-readiness`: Production checks, deployment readiness

### 4. Automated Tool Selection
- Determines which tools are needed for each subtask
- Creates optimal tool execution sequences
- Tool categories:
  - File analysis: Read, Grep, Glob
  - Code search: Grep, Glob, Task
  - File modification: Edit, MultiEdit, Write
  - System commands: Bash
  - Web research: WebSearch, WebFetch
  - Testing: Bash, Read
  - Git operations: Bash

### 5. Context-Aware Planning
- Gathers relevant context from the workspace
- Searches memory for similar past tasks
- Learns from successful task patterns
- Adapts plans based on project configuration

### 6. Production Readiness Enforcement
- Validates all code before marking tasks complete
- Checks for:
  - TODOs, FIXMEs, placeholders
  - Console.log statements
  - Empty catch blocks
  - Hardcoded secrets
  - Missing error handling
  - Any types in TypeScript
  - Mock implementations
- Automatically attempts to fix issues
- Blocks task completion if code isn't production-ready

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Feature Implementation
```
Command: "Create a user authentication system with JWT tokens, password reset, and email verification"

Analysis Result:
- Complexity: High
- Subtasks: 7 (analysis, design, implementation, testing, security, documentation, validation)
- Estimated Duration: 60 minutes
- Parallel Opportunities: 3
- Confidence: 0.85
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix
```
Command: "Fix the memory leak in the UserService class"

Analysis Result:
- Complexity: Medium
- Subtasks: 4 (analysis, implementation, testing, validation)
- Estimated Duration: 20 minutes
- Parallel Opportunities: 1
- Confidence: 0.90
```

### Example 3: Performance Optimization
```
Command: "Optimize database queries in the reporting module"

Analysis Result:
- Complexity: Medium
- Subtasks: 4 (analysis, optimization, testing, validation)
- Estimated Duration: 30 minutes
- Parallel Opportunities: 1
- Confidence: 0.80
```

## Task Execution Flow

1. **Command Analysis**
   - Parse natural language command
   - Extract intent and entities
   - Determine complexity

2. **Task Decomposition**
   - Break into logical subtasks
   - Set dependencies
   - Estimate durations

3. **Resource Assignment**
   - Assign agents to subtasks
   - Select required tools
   - Plan execution phases

4. **Parallel Execution**
   - Execute independent tasks in parallel
   - Manage dependencies
   - Track progress

5. **Production Validation**
   - Validate code quality
   - Fix issues automatically
   - Block if not production-ready

6. **Completion**
   - Update memory with results
   - Learn from execution
   - Report to user

## Benefits

1. **Automation**: Fully automatic task planning and execution
2. **Intelligence**: Learns from past tasks and improves over time
3. **Efficiency**: Parallel execution and optimal agent assignment
4. **Quality**: Enforces production standards automatically
5. **Transparency**: Clear task breakdown and progress tracking
6. **Adaptability**: Context-aware planning based on project
7. **Reliability**: Error recovery and fault tolerance
8. **Scalability**: Handles simple to complex tasks

## Configuration

The system can be configured through VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "autoclaude.workflow.enforceProductionReadiness": true,
  "autoclaude.workflow.autoScale": true,
  "autoclaude.workflow.maxAgents": 10,
  "autoclaude.workflow.learningEnabled": true,
  "autoclaude.workflow.memoryPersistence": true
}
```
