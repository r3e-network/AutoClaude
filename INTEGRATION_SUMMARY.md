- ✅ SettingsManager - Robust settings backup/restore

### 2. **VS Code Integration**
- ✅ 5 new commands in command palette
- ✅ 8 new configuration settings
- ✅ Full menu integration
- ✅ Webview monitoring dashboard
- ✅ Progress notifications

### 3. **Features Implemented**

## Benefits

1. **Massive Scale** - Run entire codebase improvements in parallel
2. **No Conflicts** - Smart coordination prevents merge conflicts
3. **Always Running** - Auto-restart keeps agents productive
4. **Full Visibility** - Real-time monitoring of all agents
5. **Tech Agnostic** - Works with 34+ technology stacks
6. **Production Ready** - Robust error handling and recovery

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Start 20 agents to fix all issues in your codebase
1. Cmd+Shift+P → "Claude Agent Farm: Start Parallel Agents"
2. Enter: 20
3. Agents launch and start working
4. Cmd+Shift+P → "Claude Agent Farm: Show Agent Monitor"
5. Watch real-time progress
6. Agents auto-restart if they fail
7. Context auto-clears when low
8. Work completes autonomously
```

## Testing

- Unit tests created for all major components
- TypeScript compilation verified
- Error handling tested
- Integration with existing features preserved

## Future Enhancements

1. **Agent Templates** - Pre-configured agent personalities
2. **Work Scheduler** - Schedule agent runs
3. **Cloud Integration** - Remote agent farms
4. **Visual Designer** - Drag-drop workflow creation
5. **Analytics** - Agent performance metrics

## Conclusion

The integration successfully brings enterprise-scale AI automation to VS Code. Users can now leverage armies of Claude agents to transform their codebases while maintaining full control and visibility through the familiar VS Code interface.
