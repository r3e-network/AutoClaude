### Technical Details
- Health checks run every 30 seconds to detect unresponsive sessions
- Automatic recovery attempts up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Session context preserved in rolling buffer (last 10 interactions)
- Recovery events emitted for monitoring and logging
- Graceful degradation when recovery fails

## [3.2.8] - 2025-07-31

### Major Fix: Python PTY Wrapper Implementation
- **Ported VS Code extension's Python PTY wrapper** to terminal tool
- Now uses the same proven approach as the VS Code extension
- Handles Claude Code CLI's rich terminal UI properly
- Fixes all connection timeout issues

### Added
- Python PTY wrapper script that properly handles terminal emulation
- Automatic Python detection (supports Python 3.8+)
- Better handling of Claude's interactive terminal interface
- Debug logging from PTY wrapper for troubleshooting

### Technical Details
- Terminal now spawns Python wrapper instead of Claude directly
- Wrapper creates proper pseudo-terminal (PTY) for Claude
- Handles ANSI escape codes and rich UI elements correctly
- Same implementation as VS Code extension for consistency

- Fixed message echo detection to start collecting responses immediately

### Improved
- Added support for Claude Code specific prompts and response patterns
- Better handling of various Claude response endings (checkmarks, success indicators)
- More robust timeout handling with proper cleanup

## [3.2.6] - 2025-07-31
