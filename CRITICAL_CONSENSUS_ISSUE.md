# CRITICAL CONSENSUS ARCHITECTURE ISSUE

## Problem Identified

Currently, blocks are being generated by Reth's dev mode (--dev flag) with automatic block production every 5 seconds. This is **architecturally incorrect** for the MultiVM system.

### Current (Incorrect) Behavior:
- Reth is running in `--dev` mode with `--dev.block-time 5sec`
- Blocks have nonce `0x0000000000000000` (no mining)
- Blocks have difficulty `0x0` (no proof of work)
- Reth is autonomously producing blocks

### Expected (Correct) Behavior:
- **MultiVM consensus layer (Malachite BFT) should generate blocks**
- Reth should only execute transactions, not produce blocks
- Block production should be coordinated by the consensus layer
- All nodes should agree on blocks through BFT consensus

## Architecture Implications

```
Current (Wrong):
┌─────────────┐
│    Reth     │ ← Generates blocks independently
│  (--dev)    │
└─────────────┘

Expected (Correct):
┌─────────────────────┐
│  MultiVM Consensus  │ ← Generates blocks
│  (Malachite BFT)    │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │ Sends blocks to execute
    ┌──────┴──────┐
    │    Reth     │ ← Only executes transactions
    │ (Engine API)│
    └─────────────┘
```

## Required Changes

1. **Remove `--dev` mode from Reth**
   - Reth should run as an execution engine only
   - Use Engine API for block production/validation

2. **Configure Reth for external consensus**
   - Remove `--dev` and `--dev.block-time` flags
   - Ensure Engine API is properly configured
   - Reth should wait for blocks from consensus layer

3. **Verify MultiVM consensus integration**
   - Consensus layer should use Engine API to:
     - Create new payloads
     - Execute blocks
     - Finalize blocks

4. **Update block production flow**
   - Consensus proposes block
   - Sends to Reth via Engine API
   - Reth executes and returns result
   - Consensus finalizes after BFT agreement

## Impact

This is a **fundamental architectural issue** that affects:
- Security (centralized vs decentralized block production)
- Consensus integrity (BFT guarantees)
- Network synchronization
- Transaction finality

## Priority: CRITICAL

This must be fixed before any production deployment. The current setup is only suitable for development/testing but violates the core MultiVM architecture principles.
