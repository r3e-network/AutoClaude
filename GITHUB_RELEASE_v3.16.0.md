# AutoClaude v3.16.0 - Agent Collaboration & Conflict Prevention

## ü§ù Major Feature: Collaborative Agent System

This release introduces a comprehensive conflict prevention and collaboration system for multiple AutoClaude agents working simultaneously.

## ‚ú® New Features

### Conflict Prevention System
- **Resource Locking**: Prevents agents from modifying the same files simultaneously
- **Exclusive vs Shared Locks**: Write operations get exclusive locks, read operations can share
- **Deadlock Detection**: Automatic detection and resolution of circular dependencies
- **Lock Expiration**: Automatic cleanup of expired locks to prevent stuck resources

### Agent Communication Channels
- **Pipeline Communication**: Agents can pass results to each other
- **Channel Subscriptions**: Agents subscribe to relevant communication channels
- **Message Broadcasting**: Agents publish their results for other agents to consume
- **Collaboration Rules**: Predefined rules for how different agent types work together

### Task Coordination Improvements
- **Dependency Management**: Tasks can declare dependencies on other tasks
- **Parallel vs Sequential**: System determines which tasks can run in parallel
- **Resource-Based Scheduling**: Tasks wait for required resources to become available
- **Automatic Rescheduling**: Failed lock acquisitions result in automatic task rescheduling

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Resource Lock Management
```typescript
// Exclusive lock for write operations
await conflictManager.acquireResourceLock(
  resourceId,
  agentId,
  taskId,
  "exclusive"
);

// Shared lock for read operations
await conflictManager.acquireResourceLock(
  resourceId,
  agentId,
  taskId,
  "shared"
);
```

### Collaboration Rules
- **Converter ‚Üí Validator**: Sequential pipeline for code conversion
- **Validator + Optimizer**: Can run in parallel on read-only operations
- **Converter ‚Üí Documenter**: Documentation runs after code changes

### Deadlock Prevention
- Periodic deadlock detection every 5 seconds
- Automatic resolution by releasing locks from lower priority agents
- Wait-for graph analysis using depth-first search

## üõ°Ô∏è Conflict Prevention Features

### Lock Types by Operation
- **Exclusive Locks**: convert-file, optimize-code, generate-tests, create-docs
- **Shared Locks**: validate-conversion, analyze-code, security-scan
- **Automatic Release**: Locks released on task completion or failure

### Communication Channels
- **conversion-pipeline**: For conversion and validation tasks
- **quality-assurance**: For testing and syntax validation
- **optimization**: For performance optimization tasks
- **documentation**: For documentation generation
- **security**: For security scanning tasks
